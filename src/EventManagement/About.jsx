          Sometimes, an event can be creatively awful in a good way by choosing
          a theme that is unexpected or unconventional. Creativity can manifest
          in event decor that goes against the traditional norms. This might
          include unusual color combinations, unconventional materials, or decor
          that intentionally clashes to create a memorable and thought-provoking
          atmosphere.
